# Email Trigger Code:

This Python script monitors a specified email inbox for unread emails from a particular sender and extracts **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) numbers**  from the email content.

It then fetches details about each CVE from the *National Vulnerability Database (NVD) API* and sends a webhook notification with the relevant information.

# Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x
2. cryptography library
3. configparser library
4. requests library
5. BeautifulSoup library
### Make sure to install these dependencies using 
1. `pip install cryptography`
2. `pip install configparser`
3. `pip install request`
4. `pip install beautifulsoup4`.

# Configuration
* Webhook URL: Replace the placeholder webhook URL with your actual webhook URL in the webhook_url variable.
* Email and IMAP Configuration: Update the config.ini file path in the config_path variable. Ensure that the configuration file (config.ini) contains the necessary details for your email account and IMAP server.

# Usage
Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

> Copy code
- **python `script_name.py`**

The script will continuously check the specified email inbox for unread emails from the specified sender.

When an eligible email is found, it extracts CVE numbers from the email content.

For each CVE number, it fetches details from the NVD API and sends a webhook notification with relevant information.

# Logging
The script logs its activities in the email_processing.log file, which is located at the specified file path. 

Check this log file for any errors or information about the script's execution.

# Schedule
The script uses the schedule library to run the check_emails_and_send_webhook function every 5 seconds. You can adjust the schedule according to your requirements.

Note: Ensure that your email provider allows IMAP access, and the specified sender's email address and server details are correct in the configuration file.

Feel free to customize the script based on your specific needs. If you encounter any issues, refer to the log file for troubleshooting information.
